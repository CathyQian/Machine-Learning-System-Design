#### 1. What kind of reliable connection is provided by a tcp/ip based socket? Is this reliability enough for distributed calls or when does it break down?
Tip
Think about failure behavior, e.g. you are trying to order something on the web and suddenly the communication breaks down.

#### 2. What are the delivery guarantees with: best effort, at least once, at most once. Which one is mostly used in distributed systems?
Tip
The best way to tackle this question is to draw a small diagram with a requester and server or client and server and draw both the request and the response into it. Now think about the problems caused when a) the request does not get through, b) the server crashes during request processing and c) the response is lost on its way back.

#### 3. What is the advantage if your server side processing uses threads instead of a single process?
Tip
Think about what happens if your server receives multiple requests at the same time

#### 4. What is the problem behind keeping state for a client on a server?
Tip
Think about different client scenarios where clients disappear or a rush of clients happens.

#### 5. What is a proxy? Give an example of where a proxy can be used.
Tip
Do you always know that there is a proxy between a client and a certain service?
