#### 1. Name two mechanisms that can be used to ensure performance in distributed systems
Tip
Think about the "distributed fallacies": if a request takes a long time between requester and sender, what could you do with the data? Do you always get the data just when they are requested or can you separate cient request from backend request?
#### 2. List some architectures that you need to define for distributed systems
Tip
If you want to avoid performance problems, what do you need to know about other services? If you want to cache data, what do you need to know about the data? If your user base might grow considerably over the time, what should you be able to do with your machines?
#### 3. Why is extreme testing a part of necessary architectural validation of your design? What can happen if you delay it until the end of development?
Tip
Think about "paper-pushing" projects that end in desaster
