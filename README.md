What is a recent paper you read that you are excited about?

Given some situation with data and labels, ask what kind of architecture they'd use to solve the problem.
What is SGD in your own words? How can dropout be useful in a network? What is the use for a 1x1 convolution?
--- How do you keep yourself updated?

--- What are your latest projects in ML? Pick one, pet project, interesting work stuff, what ever.

-- Do you deal with big data? if so, in what capacity?

-- What are your go to packages?

-- How do you evaluate your model? (CV, ROC curve, accuracy, sampling, etc. etc. )

-- When would you use ML? When would you use NN?

-- Tell me a big or expensive mistake you've made.

-- What techniques do you use to fine tune hyper parameters?

-- Give then an example data frame, see what the fuck they'll do with it.
